For all other skills, use the 'Skill' tool:**\\n\\n---\\nname: using-superpowers\\ndescription: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\\n---\\n\\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\\n\\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\\n\\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\\n\\n# Using Skills\\n\\n## The Rule\\n\\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\\n\\n```dot\\ndigraph skill_flow {\\n    \\\"User message received\\\" [shape=doublecircle];\\n    \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\" [shape=diamond];\\n    \\\"Invoke Skill tool\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Has checklist?\\\" [shape=diamond];\\n    \\\"Create TodoWrite todo per item\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Follow skill exactly\\\" [shape=box];\\n    \\\"Respond (including clarifications)\\\" [shape=doublecircle];\\n\\n    \\\"User message received\\\" -> \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\";\\n    \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\" -> \\\"Invoke Skill tool\\\" [label=\\\"yes, even 1%\\\"];\\n    \\\"Might any skill apply?\\\" -> \\\"Respond (including clarifications)\\\" [label=\\\"definitely not\\\"];\\n    \\\"Invoke Skill tool\\\" -> \\\"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\\\";\\n    \\\"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\\\" -> \\\"Has checklist?\\\";\\n    \\\"Has checklist?\\\" -> \\\"Create TodoWrite todo per item\\\" [label=\\\"yes\\\"];\\n    \\\"Has checklist?\\\" -> \\\"Follow skill exactly\\\" [label=\\\"no\\\"];\\n    \\\"Create TodoWrite todo per item\\\" -> \\\"Follow skill exactly\\\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Red Flags\\n\\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\\n\\n| Thought | Reality |\\n|---------|---------|\\n| \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"I need more context first\\\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\\n| \\\"Let me explore the codebase first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\\n| \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\\n| \\\"I remember this skill\\\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\\n| \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\\n| \\\"The skill is overkill\\\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\\n| \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\\n| \\\"This feels productive\\\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\\n| \\\"I know what that means\\\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\\n\\n## Skill Priority\\n\\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\\n\\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\\n\\n\\\"Let's build X\\\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\\n\\\"Fix this bug\\\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\\n\\n## Skill Types\\n\\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\\n\\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which.\\n\\n## User Instructions\\n\\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \\\"Add X\\\" or \\\"Fix Y\\\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\\n\\n\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}
